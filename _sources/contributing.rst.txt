Pull requests

When you submit a PR, you'll see a template that pops up - it's reproduced
here.


- Provide a general summary of your changes in the Title
- Describe your changes in detail
- If the PR closes an issue, make sure to include, e.g., `fix #4` or similar,
  or if it just relates to an issue, make sure to mention it like `#4`
- If introducing a new feature or changing behavior of existing
  methods/functions, include an example if possible to do in brief form
- Did you remember to include tests? Unless you're changing docs/grammar,
  please include new tests for your change


Writing tests
-------------

We're using `pytest` for testing. See the `pytest docs`_ for
help on contributing to or writing tests.

The Makefile has a task for testing with vcr (using fixtures: `make test`) and without (`make test_no_vcr`)
